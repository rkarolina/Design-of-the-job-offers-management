This is a documentation created by me during my engineering thesis.
The "Design of the job offers management system" concerns the topic of recruitment. Its purpose is to identify the needs of participants of the recruitment process, such as candidate and recruiter.
Documentation contains:
- the analysis of business requirements
- preparation of process diagrams and use cases
- design of a database tailored to the needs of recruitment (database created in MS SQL Management Studio)
- implementation of a prototype (mock-ups created in Figma, HTML, CSS, JavaScript code) 
- project analysis after implementation (SWOT)
